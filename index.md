### Let's work together.

Thanks for visiting my website! You can find more info about me, my resume, and my tech blog here. I'm currently a 3rd-year student at The University of Texas, studying computer science. I'm completing my BS in May of 2020. When I'm not studying, I'm trying to make my friends laugh, or working as the Vice President of Seva Charities, the largest South Asian charity at UT. 

I love solving problems that address the inconveniences of life, to make some of the little things in life a little bit easier. Software is powerful, and I find it best used to help the lives around me. I got into programming when I hacked my Android phone in 2010 so that I could get games for free, and each year since, I'm confident that this is what I was meant to do. Let's help the world together.
