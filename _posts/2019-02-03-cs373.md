#1. What did you do this past week?
This week, I got back into the swing of things. It was my first full week of school in a while, and I spent a lot of time catching up assignments and figuring out how to organize the days ahead.
#2. What's in your way?
Time management mostly
What will you do next week?
What's your experience of the in-class exercises? (this question will vary, week to week)
What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
